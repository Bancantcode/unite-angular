# UNITE 
UNITE is a web development company website we created to demonstrate our proficiency in using the Angular framework, especially on the Angular Directives and Routing. UI/UX design principles were also applied using Tailwind CSS to deliver an aesthetically pleasing and responsive user interface. This project was done as a prelim project requirement for the Advanced Dynamic Web Applications (AWEB) course.

The website consists of five pages: the Home (Landing) Page, About Page, Services Page, Contacts Page, and a custom 404 Error Page for an enhanced user experience. 

You may access the website here: https://unitewebdev.netlify.app/

## Angular Directives
The "Meet the Team" section on the About Page is dynamically rendered using `*ngFor` directive to iterate through profile data and the `*ngIf` directive to conditionally display content.

## Angular Routing
Routes are implemented for each of the website's pages for navigation, including a custom 404 page for invalid routes.
